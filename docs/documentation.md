# University Timetable Optimizer Documentation

## Overview

The University Timetable Optimizer is a web-based application that uses evolutionary algorithms to automatically generate optimal course timetables. The system considers various constraints such as room availability, lecturer schedules, and course durations to create conflict-free timetables.

## System Architecture

### 1. Core Components

#### Data Models (src/models/timetable.py)
- **Course**: Represents a university course
  - Properties: id, name, duration, required_rooms, lecturer
- **Lecturer**: Represents a teaching staff member
  - Properties: id, name, available_slots
- **TimeSlot**: Represents a scheduled time slot
  - Properties: day, period, room
- **Timetable**: Main class for timetable management
  - Handles scheduling logic and constraint checking

#### Optimization Algorithms (src/algorithms/)

1. **Particle Swarm Optimization (pso.py)**
   - Population-based optimization technique
   - Each particle represents a potential timetable solution
   - Parameters:
     - Number of particles
     - Number of iterations
     - Inertia weight
     - Cognitive and social weights
     - Maximum velocity

2. **Genetic Algorithm (genetic.py)**
   - Evolutionary optimization approach
   - Uses natural selection principles
   - Features:
     - Tournament selection
     - Uniform crossover
     - Adaptive mutation
     - Elitism

### 2. Data Management

#### JSON Data Storage
- **courses.json**: Stores course information
  ```json
  {
    "id": 9,
    "name": "Machine Learning",
    "duration": 2,
    "required_rooms": [0, 2],
    "lecturer": 5
  }
  ```
- **lecturers.json**: Stores lecturer information
  ```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Dr. Hossam",
    "available_slots": [[0,1], [0,2], [1,3]]  // [day, period] pairs
  }
  ```

### 3. User Interface (app.py)

#### Main Features
1. **Data Management**
   - Add/remove courses and lecturers
   - Set course requirements
   - Define lecturer availability

2. **Algorithm Settings**
   - Choose optimization algorithm (PSO or GA)
   - Configure algorithm parameters
   - Set optimization constraints

3. **Timetable Display**
   - Interactive timetable view
   - Filter by days and rooms
   - Clear visualization of course and lecturer assignments

## Implementation Details

### 1. Constraint Handling

The system enforces several constraints:
- No room double-booking
- No lecturer schedule conflicts
- Courses must be in required rooms
- Respect lecturer availability
- Maintain course duration requirements

### 2. Solution Encoding

Both algorithms use a similar solution encoding:
- Each solution is an array of values
- Values are grouped in triplets: [day, period, room]
- Day ranges: 0-4 (Monday to Friday)
- Period ranges: 0-7 (8 periods per day)
- Room ranges: 0-7 (8 available rooms)

### 3. Fitness Evaluation

The fitness function considers:
1. Hard constraints (must be satisfied):
   - No scheduling conflicts
   - Room availability
   - Lecturer availability

2. Soft constraints (preferences):
   - Preferred time slots
   - Room preferences
   - Continuous scheduling

## Usage Guide
